Tried Solutions:
Verified AWS access keys and secret keys.
Ensured the correct endpoint (webservices.amazon.fr).
Checked the format of request headers and body.
Used both us-east-1 and eu-west-1 regions.

Issues Encountered:

1. **Error Encountered**: 
   Every API request results in the following error:
   ```json
   {
       "Output": {
           "__type": "com.amazon.coral.service#InternalFailure"
       },
       "Version": "1.0"
   }

2. API Key Issues: Problems with passing the Amazon API keys to the search method.
